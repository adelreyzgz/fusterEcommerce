    <p>
        The service provider reserves the right to modify any type of information that may appear on the web site, with no requirement to notify users or make users aware of the said obligations, it being considered that publication on the
        service provider’s web site is sufficient.
    </p>
    <h5>Liability</h5>
    <p>The service provider shall not accept any type of liability in respect of the information published on its web site if that information has been manipulated or inserted by a third party external to the same.</p>

    </p>
    <p>
        From the web site, it is possible to be redirected to content from third-party web site. Since the service provider is not always able to control the content inserted by third parties into its web site, the latter does not accept
        any type of liability with respect to the said content. In any case, the service provider states that it will immediately remove any content that may contravene national or international legislation, public decency, or public order,
        with immediate removal of the redirection to the said web site and with the competent authorities being informed of the content in question.
    </p>
    <p>
        The service provider does not accept liability for the information and content stored in (the following list is not exhaustive) forums, chats, blog generators, comments, social networks, or any other medium that enables third
        parties to publish content independently on the service provider’s web page. However, and in compliance with the provisions of articles 11 and 16 of the LSSI-CE, the service provider makes itself available to all users, authorities,
        and security forces. In addition, it works to remove or, where appropriate, block, all content that may affect or contravene national or international legislation, third-party rights, public decency, or public order. If users feel
